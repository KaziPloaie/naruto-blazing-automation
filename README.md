# naruto-blazing-automation
[Naruto Blazing](https://naruto-blazing.net/en/) is a mobile game based on the popular anime Naruto. The game requires repeating missions/trials for multiple times to farm characters and materials, which is extremely time-consuming. The project intends to automate trivial scroll/ramen/crystal farming with [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org) scripts. In the future, I also want to investigate the possibility of nontrivial impact/emergency mission/multiplayer automation [using deep learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoBlazing/comments/6plzhw/autoplay_srand_raids/).
